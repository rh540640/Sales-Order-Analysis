# Sales-Order-Analysis

I conducted an in-depth analysis of a sales order dataset using SQL, specifically MySQL. The dataset, sourced from a freemium download on the web, was enriched with additional columns including Margin and Category. Data preprocessing was carried out, and several new columns were introduced, such as total cost and net profit. The dataset contained a total of 140,787 unique records. Over 15 pivot tables were created to facilitate data analysis.

Key Insights:

1. Tuesdays emerged as the busiest day for order counts. This insight can inform operational planning and resource allocation for the business.

2. The primary source of revenue came from sales of Macbook Pro Laptops, followed closely by iPhone sales. These products should be a focal point for marketing and promotion efforts.

3. While Macbook Pro Laptops and iPhones contributed the most to revenue, ThinkPad Laptops and Macbook Laptops had the highest average profit margins. Identifying and promoting such high-margin products can boost overall profitability.

4. San Francisco was the city with the highest purchasing activity, followed by Los Angeles. Understanding regional preferences and market dynamics in these cities can help tailor marketing strategies.
